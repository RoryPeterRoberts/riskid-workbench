# DECISIONS

Decision log for the RiskID Workbench build. One line per decision. Any
dependency added outside `PLAN.md` section 2 needs a line here (rule 10 of
`PLAN.md` section 1); any deviation from `SPEC.md` needs a line and a question.

- round 0: use the `PLAN.md` section 2 dependency set exactly (fastapi,
  uvicorn, jinja2, python-multipart, openpyxl, matplotlib, weasyprint,
  python-docx, pytest, httpx). All are named in `PLAN.md` section 2, so this
  adds no new dependency.
- round 0: the root route returns JSON `{"title": "RiskID Workbench"}`; the
  title is `RiskID Workbench`, matching the `FastAPI` app title.
